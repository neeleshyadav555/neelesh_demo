What is a galaxy galaxy?

1
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.140
Until the 19 twenties, we only knew of our own galaxy,

2
00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:14.640
the MilkyMilkyMilky Way.

3
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.420
Even with telescopes, we could barely see little fuzzy spiral shapes in the sky,

4
00:00:20.889 --> 00:00:22.920
and we wondered what, exactly they were

5
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.649
dusty nebulas

6
00:00:24.809 --> 00:00:26.799
or other Galaxies entirely.

7
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.860
There was a great debate about the issue.

8
00:00:34.779 --> 00:00:35.669
Ultimately,

9
00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.389
Henrietta Swan Leavitt's work on distances to stars

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.630
enabled Edwin Hubble to prove that the largest

11
00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:47.959
fuzzy spiral shape in the sky was actually a galaxy entirely separate from our own.

12
00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:50.029
The Andromeda Galaxy

13
00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:53.380
so cool.

14
00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:57.270
It was the beginning of our discovering and grasping

15
00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:59.509
the vastness of space.

16
00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:01.549
Since Andromeda,

17
00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.910
we've learned there are billions more Galaxies outside of the Milky Way.

18
00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:11.589
Galaxies are concentrations of stars, gas, dust and dark matter,

19
00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.750
all held together by gravity.

20
00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:19.139
Many Galaxies are spiral Galaxies like the Milky Way,

21
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.410
but there are also elliptical and irregular Galaxies.

22
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.699
As far as we know,

23
00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:30.610
all large Galaxies have a super massive black hole at their centres.

24
00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.319
We also know that Galaxies interact with each other,

25
00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.319
creating beautiful new forms over millions of years.

26
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.480
This is true for Andromeda and the Milky Way, too.

27
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:48.650
Our galaxy is on a collision course with our nearest neighbour.

28
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.139
While that may seem violent to you and me,

29
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.690
Alexis

30
00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:56.839
are so huge that most stars will pass right by each other

31
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.569
few.

32
00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:02.699
Eventually, the Milky Way and Andromeda will merge

33
00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.059
into one giant new elliptical galaxy.

34
00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:11.768
It's not for another several billion years, but

35
00:02:12.078 --> 00:02:16.289
it's sure to be a spectacular show for the stargazers of the distant future.
